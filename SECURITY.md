## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of `Pure Finance`. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at info@pure.finance by following the [issue template](https://github.com/purefinance/pure.finance/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Pure Finance bug bounty program

The project engages in an official bug bounty program for security researchers and responsible public disclosures.
See #dev-general channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Pm8UDaazsK) for further details.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
  released as fast as possible to npm.
